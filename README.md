### What I learned

I'm used this section for recaptulation over some of my major learnings while working through this project.
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

I figured out how to make them work, it was magical, I'm grateful for every knowledge shared.
```html
<h1> <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css"> </h1>
```
Another magic was the use of the CSS pseudo-class :root which is equivalent to the root of a tree, which in turn represents the document.

```css
:root {

     /* primary */
     --soft-blue: hsl(215, 51%, 70%);
     --cyan: hsl(178, 100%, 50%);
     --cyan-trans: hsla(178, 100%, 50%, 0.561);

     /* netural */
     --very-dark-blue-main-bg: hsl(217, 54%, 11%); /* main background */
     --very-dark-blue-card-bg: hsl(216, 50%, 16%); /* card background */
     --very-dark-blue-line: hsl(215, 32%, 27%); /* line */
     --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%)
 }

```

### Continued development

I want to keep learning more about different styles and combinations, perfecting new techniques for cleaner and more organized code.

### Useful resources

- [CSS|MDN](https://www.example.com](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/CSS) -   I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

## Acknowledgments

I am grateful for each person who has already taken up the challenge and allowed us to have access to their codes and understand new ways of developing something on this level, 
I have always believed that the best way to learn something is by looking at those who came before and allowed the vision of something extraordinary, sharpening the creativity of others.
